Thank you for taking the time to review my test and read this README file.

I have minimal knowledge of Javascript and thus could not implement any in this project. I'm very willing to learn it should I be successful in this application.
I've used Django to build this page and thus have used template tags to seperate the indivdual elements of the site for ease of reading.

I look forward to receiving your feedback and please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any further questions.

Regards
Myles
